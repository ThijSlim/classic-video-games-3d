# Architectural Analysis: Princess Peach's Castle

**Analysis Date:** 12 February 2026
**Source:** Reference image (3/4 aerial perspective, south-east elevation)
**Context:** Virtual structure from the Super Mario franchise — analyzed as if it were a real-world building for 3D reconstruction purposes.

---

## 1. First Impression & Classification

- **Building type:** Institutional / palatial residence — royal castle
- **Architectural style:** Romanesque Revival with fairytale vernacular influences. Rounded arched openings, heavy masonry walls, and a prominent central tower echo 11th–12th century European fortifications, but with softened, stylized proportions.
- **Era / period:** Stylistically references late medieval European castle design (12th–14th century), adapted with whimsical proportions.
- **Scale classification:** Mid-rise — approximately 4–5 stories for the main body, with the central tower reaching 7–8 story equivalent height.

**Confidence: High**

---

## 2. Structural System Analysis

- **Primary structural system:** Load-bearing masonry — thick stone block walls acting as both structure and envelope. Wall thickness estimated at 1.0–1.5m based on window reveal depth.
- **Foundation type:** Inferred as a combination of strip and raft foundation given the structure sits on level ground behind a foreground hill, with a deep excavated defensive moat at its base. Likely bearing on bedrock or compacted fill.
- **Load path description:** Gravity loads transfer through the massive masonry walls directly down to the foundation. The central tower acts as a load-bearing core, with the roofs supported by the perimeter walls and internal cross-walls.
- **Lateral bracing system:** The thick masonry walls with perpendicular cross-walls at the corner turrets provide inherent lateral stability. The cruciform plan with four corner turrets creates a naturally braced configuration.
- **Span estimates:**
  - Main hall width: ~12–15m (estimated from facade proportions)
  - Central tower: ~6–8m × 6–8m square plan
  - Corner turret diameter: ~4–5m
- **Structural grid:** Roughly symmetrical about the primary axis (front-to-back). The four corner turrets define a rectangular structural bay of approximately 20m × 15m.

**Confidence: Medium** — inferred from visible proportions using the entrance arch (~3.5m wide) as reference.

## 3. Geometric & Dimensional Analysis

### Reference Objects Used
- Main entrance arch: estimated width ~3.5m, height ~4.0m
- Circular windows: estimated diameter ~1.2m
- Standard floor-to-floor height: ~4.0m (castle scale)

### Estimated Dimensions
| Element | Estimated Dimension |
|---|---|
| Total height (tower peak) | ~32–36m (105–118 ft) |
| Main body height (to eave) | ~14–16m (46–52 ft) |
| Central tower height above roof | ~16–18m (52–59 ft) |
| Facade width (front elevation) | ~28–32m (92–105 ft) |
| Building depth | ~20–24m (66–79 ft) |
| Floor-to-floor height | ~3.5–4.0m (11.5–13 ft) |
| Corner turret diameter | ~4–5m (13–16 ft) |
| Window (circular) diameter | ~1.0–1.2m (3.3–3.9 ft) |
| Entrance arch width | ~3.5m (11.5 ft) |
| Entrance arch height | ~4.0m (13 ft) |
| Moat width | ~4–6m (13–20 ft) |
| Bridge span | ~6–8m (20–26 ft) |

### Angles & Slopes
| Element | Angle / Slope |
|---|---|
| Main roof pitch | ~45° (12:12 ratio) — steep hip roof |
| Corner turret roof pitch | ~60–65° (conical, steep) |
| Central tower roof pitch | ~55–60° (conical/pyramidal) |
| Wall inclination | 0° — vertical, no batter visible |
| Bridge gradient | ~5–8% (slight upward slope toward entrance) |

### Symmetry
- **Strong bilateral symmetry** about the front-to-back central axis.
- The front facade is symmetrical with balanced corner turrets and a centered entrance.
- The large stained-glass window is centered on the upper front facade.
- Minor asymmetry: the bridge and approach path are centered.

### Setbacks & Offsets
- The central tower rises from the roof ridge with no setback — directly above the intersection of the cruciform roof.
- Corner turrets project slightly beyond the main wall plane (~0.5–1.0m).
- The main body sits at ground level behind the foreground hill, with the deep defensive moat excavated ~4–6m below the surrounding grade.

**Confidence: Medium** — dimensions estimated from proportional analysis against the entrance arch.

---

## 4. Facade & Envelope Analysis

### Facade System
- **Type:** Solid load-bearing stone masonry — ashlar-cut blocks with visible coursing.
- **Block dimensions:** Approximately 0.3m × 0.6m (12" × 24") — regular rectangular coursing.
- **Color:** Light warm grey with slight cream/buff tone.

### Fenestration Pattern
- **Window-to-wall ratio:** ~8–10% — very low, consistent with fortified castle design.
- **Window types:**
  - Circular (oculus) windows: 8 visible on the front facade, arranged in two rows (4 upper, 4 lower). Each framed with a raised circular surround in a bronze/gold tone.
  - One large Gothic pointed-arch stained-glass window centered on the upper front facade, approximately 3.0m wide × 5.0m tall.
- **Glazing:** The circular windows appear to have decorative cross-mullion patterns (quatrefoil or cross design). The stained-glass window depicts Princess Peach in vivid colors (gold, blue, pink, red).
- **Mullion pattern:** Cross-pattern mullions in the circular windows, leaded glass divisions in the stained-glass feature window.

### Entrance & Openings
- **Main entry:** Large semi-circular arch, approximately 3.5m wide × 4.0m tall. Dark void behind suggests a deep entrance vestibule or tunnel through the thick wall. No visible door — open archway.
- **Approach:** A wooden bridge with timber deck and fence/railing spans the moat, leading directly to the entrance.

### Facade Articulation
- Minimal articulation — the walls are relatively flat with subtle coursing texture.
- The circular window surrounds project slightly (~50mm) creating shadow lines.
- A subtle horizontal string course / water table is visible at approximately first-floor level.
- The stained-glass window has a pointed Gothic arch frame that projects from the wall plane.

### Color Palette
- **Dominant:** Light warm grey (stone masonry) — approximately 70%
- **Secondary:** Terracotta/orange-red (roof tiles) — approximately 20%
- **Accents:** Gold/bronze (window surrounds), red (turret flags), polychrome (stained glass) — approximately 10%

**Confidence: High**

## 5. Roof & Crown Analysis

### Main Roof
- **Type:** Steep hip roof on the main body, with the ridgeline running front-to-back.
- **Pitch:** ~45° (12:12)
- **Material:** Clay or terracotta roof tiles in an interlocking/overlapping pattern. Color is a rich orange-red.
- **Tile pattern:** Fish-scale or scalloped pattern — tiles appear to be ~0.3m × 0.3m with a curved lower edge.

### Central Tower Roof
- **Type:** Conical/pyramidal spire.
- **Pitch:** ~55–60°.
- **Material:** Same terracotta tiles as main roof.
- **Height:** Approximately 8–10m from tower wall top to apex.

### Corner Turret Roofs
- **Type:** Conical roofs (witch's hat style), 4 total.
- **Pitch:** ~60–65° — steeper than the main roof.
- **Material:** Same terracotta tiles.
- **Flagpoles:** Each turret is topped with a red pennant/flag on a thin pole extending approximately 2m above the cone apex.

### Drainage
- No visible gutters or downpipes — roof tiles likely shed water directly off the eave edge. Given the steep pitch, water velocity would be high at the eave.
- The moat surrounding the castle serves as the ultimate stormwater collection system.

### Eaves
- The main roof has a moderate eave overhang of approximately 0.5–0.8m beyond the wall face.
- No visible soffit detail — the tiles appear to terminate at a flush eave line.

**Confidence: High**

---

## 6. Terrain & Landscape Analysis

### Topography Classification
- **Type:** Gently undulating to hilly — a stylized pastoral landscape of rolling green hills with a prominent foreground hill that partially obscures the castle behind it.
- **Spatial arrangement:** Mario stands on the approach side looking up at the foreground hill. The castle is positioned **behind** this hill, at a lower or similar elevation, with the upper portions of the castle (tower, turrets, roofline) visible rising above the hill's crest. The castle is not on top of the hill.
- **Character:** The terrain reads as sculpted/constructed rather than naturally eroded — uniform curvature, unnaturally smooth contours, no exposed rock or erosion features. Consistent with a designed royal estate or formal castle grounds.

### Elevation Profile

| Zone | Estimated Elevation (relative to surrounding ground level = 0m) |
|---|---|
| Foreground sandy plaza (Mario's position) | 0.0m (datum) |
| Foreground hill crest (between Mario and castle) | +8.0 to +10.0m |
| Castle ground level (behind the hill) | 0.0 to +2.0m |
| Castle entrance threshold | +0.5 to +1.5m |
| Moat water surface | −4.0 to −6.0m (deeply excavated below grade) |
| Moat bottom | −5.5 to −7.5m |
| Surrounding grass fields | 0.0 to +3.0m |
| Hilltops flanking the scene (left & right) | +10.0 to +14.0m |
| Distant ridge / mountain (background right) | +20.0 to +30.0m (estimated) |

- **Maximum visible elevation change:** ~36m from the moat bottom to the distant ridge peak.
- **Foreground hill height:** ~8–10m above the foreground plaza — the dominant terrain feature separating Mario from the castle.
- **Moat depth below grade:** ~4–6m — a deeply excavated medieval-style defensive trench with water at the bottom, well below the surrounding ground level.
- **Slope gradients on the foreground hill:**
  - Front face (Mario's side / south): **moderate 15–25%** (1:6 to 1:4) — a climbable grass slope.
  - Rear face (castle side / north): **steeper 25–40%** (1:4 to 1:2.5) — drops down toward the castle's ground level and moat.
  - Flanking sides (east/west): **moderate 20–30%** — merging into the surrounding rolling terrain.

### Terrain Geometry

- **Contour patterns:** Concentric near-elliptical contours around the foreground hill, radiating outward and flattening into the surrounding meadow. The hill is roughly elliptical in plan with an estimated base diameter of ~60–80m. Behind the hill, the terrain drops back to near-foreground level where the castle sits.
- **Ridge lines:** The foreground hill forms a prominent ridge that visually separates the approach area from the castle grounds. A subtle ridge extends from the left background hills. A separate higher ridge/mountain is visible at the far right background.
- **Saddle points:** Low saddles exist between the foreground hill and the flanking hills to the left and right — these form natural corridors to walk around the hill toward the castle.
- **Plateaus:** The foreground sandy area is essentially a small flat plateau or terrace at the base of the hill, approximately 20m × 30m. The castle grounds behind the hill form a second, larger flat area at approximately the same elevation.

### Surface Composition & Ground Materials

| Surface | Location | Approximate Coverage | Hex Color (est.) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Short-mown grass (lush green) | Foreground hill, castle grounds, surrounding hills | ~55% | `#4CAF50` to `#66BB6A` |
| Sandy/packed earth | Foreground plaza, path approaches | ~20% | `#D4A84B` to `#C8A44A` |
| Water (moat) | Deep trench encircling the castle base | ~5% | `#2196F3` to `#42A5F5` |
| Dirt path | Approach road from foreground | ~5% | `#B8943D` to `#C49E52` |
| Tree canopy (overhead view of ground coverage) | Scattered across hills | ~10% | `#2E7D32` to `#388E3C` |
| Distant blue-grey (sky-terrain merge) | Background mountains/horizon | ~5% | `#90CAF9` to `#A5C8E0` |

- **Surface condition:** Immaculate — no erosion, ruts, bare patches, or waterlogged areas. The grass appears uniformly healthy and freshly maintained.

### Natural Landforms

- **Hills/mounds:**
  - **Foreground hill (central):** Dome-shaped, ~8–10m rise above the foreground plaza, ~60–80m base diameter. Symmetrical, grass-covered. This hill stands **between** Mario and the castle — the castle is visible behind/above its crest. The hill is a separate landform; the castle does not sit on it.
  - **Left flanking hill:** Elongated dome, ~10–14m rise above foreground, extends to the north-west. Approximately 80–100m visible extent.
  - **Right flanking hill:** Steeper, taller — part of a larger ridge/mountain system visible in the background. ~20–30m rise. Extends beyond the image frame to the north-east.
  - **Far-left slope (partially visible):** A steep sandy/brown slope at the extreme left edge, possibly a cliff face or excavated hillside. Slope angle ~35–45°. Surface appears sandy/loam rather than grass.
- **Water features:**
  - **Moat:** A deeply excavated medieval defensive trench, ~4–6m wide, cut ~4–6m **below** the surrounding ground level. The water surface sits well below grade, creating a formidable defensive barrier. Steep, near-vertical stone-lined walls drop from ground level to the water. The moat encircles the castle at its base. Water is calm, no visible current. Fed by unknown source — possibly spring-fed or connected to a larger water body.
  - No rivers, streams, or waterfalls visible in the foreground area.

### Constructed Terrain Features

- **Foreground hill:** The most prominent terrain feature in the approach view. This natural or lightly graded hill stands between Mario's position and the castle, ~8–10m high. Its crest partially obscures the castle's lower walls, with the upper structure (tower, turrets, roofline) rising dramatically above the hilltop.
  - **Hill profile:** Dome / bell curve profile in cross-section.
  - **Base area:** ~60–80m diameter.
  - **Side slopes:** 15–40% gradient, varying by face (gentler on the approach side, steeper toward the castle).
- **Excavated moat (defensive trench):** The most significant constructed terrain modification. A deep trench ~4–6m wide and ~4–6m deep is cut into the ground around the castle perimeter, well below the surrounding grade. Both inner and outer walls are steep, near-vertical (~75–85° face angle), lined with stone retaining walls. The water level sits ~4–6m below the ground surface — a true medieval defensive moat.
  - **Inner moat wall:** Near-vertical stone, rising from waterline to castle ground level.
  - **Outer moat wall:** Near-vertical stone, rising from waterline to surrounding grade.
- **Bridge:** Spans the deep moat trench from the surrounding grade level across to the castle entrance. The bridge deck is approximately level, but the drop to the water below is ~4–6m — a significant defensive gap.
- **Paths/trails:**
  - A main approach path runs from the foreground plaza, around or over the hill, toward the bridge and castle. Width ~3–4m, sandy/packed earth surface.
  - A secondary path branches left toward a signpost/bulletin board.

### Vegetation & Ground Cover

- **Trees:**
  - **Type:** Stylized deciduous trees with spherical/lollipop-shaped canopies. Broad, round crown shape suggests ornamental or parkland species (oak, maple, or plane tree equivalent).
  - **Dimensions:** Height ~5–7m, canopy diameter ~3–4m, trunk diameter ~0.3–0.4m. Single straight trunk with crown starting at ~2.5–3.0m height.
  - **Placement pattern:** Semi-random organic distribution, clustered on the flanking hillsides and the foreground hill. ~8–12 trees visible. Spacing ~8–15m apart. No trees on the castle grounds immediately around the moat — clear zone maintained around the fortification (historically accurate to real castle design for defensive sightlines).
  - **Tree colors:** Dark green canopy (`#2E7D32`), brown trunk (`#5D4037`). One tree in the left foreground shows slightly lighter green, possibly a different species or sun angle.
- **Grass:**
  - Covers all terrain surfaces except the sandy areas and water.
  - Short-mown appearance (~50mm height), bright saturated green.
  - Uniform coverage and health — no brown patches, weeds, or bare areas.
  - Color shifts from bright yellow-green in sunlit areas (`#7CB342`) to deeper green in shade/distance (`#388E3C`).
- **No visible shrubs, hedges, flower beds, or garden features** — the landscape is pure grass with scattered trees, creating a parkland/savanna aesthetic.

### Terrain–Structure Relationship

This is the critical analysis dimension for 3D reconstruction:

- **Siting strategy:** The castle sits on relatively level ground **behind** the foreground hill, not on top of it. From Mario's perspective in the foreground, first the green hill rises ~8–10m, and beyond/behind it the castle sits at approximately the same elevation as Mario. The castle's upper structure (tower, turrets, roofline) is visible above the hill's crest, creating a dramatic reveal as the player approaches and crests the hill.
- **Depth layering:** The scene reads as a layered composition: foreground plaza → foreground hill → castle grounds (behind hill) → flanking hills → distant mountains. The hill acts as a visual screen that builds anticipation.
- **Foundation exposure:** No foundation is exposed — the castle walls rise from the ground level behind the hill. The deep moat trench is the primary terrain feature at the castle's base.
- **Grading around structure:**
  - **Positive drainage:** The ground around the castle slopes gently toward the moat, directing surface water into the deep defensive trench on all sides.
  - The deeply excavated moat acts as the primary collection channel for all surface runoff.
- **Integration quality:** **High** — the foreground hill partially frames and reveals the castle, creating a dramatic compositional effect. The castle emerges from behind the natural landscape rather than dominating it from above.
- **Approach sequence (processional):**
  1. Sandy plaza (flat, open — gathering/orientation space) → elevation 0m
  2. Hill ascent (climbing the foreground hill, ~15–25% grade) → elevation +8 to +10m at crest
  3. Hill descent (down the far side toward the castle, ~25–40% grade) → elevation returns to ~0 to +2m
  4. Bridge crossing over deep moat (dramatic threshold — looking down ~4–6m to water below) → elevation ~0 to +1m
  5. Castle entrance arch (arrival — enclosed, shadowed) → elevation ~+0.5 to +1.5m
  - Total elevation change on approach: **up ~10m over the hill, then back down ~8–10m**, arriving at approximately the starting elevation

### Drainage & Hydrology

- **Surface flow:** Terrain surfaces around the castle slope gently toward the moat trench. The foreground hill sheds water both toward Mario's plaza and toward the castle grounds behind.
- **Moat function:** Triple purpose — deep defensive barrier (~4–6m below grade), stormwater collection basin, and psychological deterrent. The deeply excavated trench concentrates all runoff from the surrounding terrain. The moat likely overflows at the lowest point to a natural drainage channel (not visible).
- **Erosion evidence:** None — the grass cover is complete and intact, providing full erosion protection on all slopes. The sandy foreground area shows no rilling or gullying. The stone-lined moat walls prevent erosion of the trench sides.
- **Water table indicators:** The deeply excavated moat intersects the water table, keeping it permanently filled. The lush green grass further indicates adequate soil moisture throughout the site.

## 7. Ground Level & Site Analysis

### Ground Floor Treatment
- The ground floor / base level features the main entrance arch, centered on the front facade.
- The wall surface at ground level matches the upper levels — continuous stone masonry.
- No visible retail, colonnade, or secondary openings on the front elevation.

### Landscaping
- **Softscape:** Lush green grass covering the rolling hills surrounding the castle. Stylized rounded deciduous trees (~4–6m tall) scattered around the grounds.
- **Hardscape:** A sandy/dirt path leads to the bridge approach. A timber fence lines portions of the path.
- **Moat:** A water-filled moat approximately 4–6m wide encircles the castle base. The water appears calm and blue.

### Grading & Levels
- The castle sits on level ground behind the foreground hill, at approximately the same elevation as Mario's foreground plaza.
- A prominent green hill (~8–10m high) rises between Mario and the castle, partially obscuring the castle's lower walls from the approach.
- The moat is a deeply excavated trench (~4–6m below grade) encircling the castle — the bridge spans this deep gap at ground level, with the water far below.

### Site Features
- **Bridge:** Timber construction, approximately 6–8m span, 3–4m width. Features timber railings/fencing on both sides. Appears to be a simple beam bridge with timber deck planking.
- **Surrounding context:** Green rolling hills with scattered trees to the south and west. A body of water (ocean or large lake) visible to the north/east beyond the hills.
- **Perimeter fencing:** Low wooden post-and-rail fence visible along portions of the approach path.

**Confidence: High**

## 8. Material & Construction Assessment

### Primary Materials Inventory
| Material | Usage | Estimated Coverage |
|---|---|---|
| Cut stone / ashlar masonry (light grey) | All walls, tower, turrets | ~60% of visible surface |
| Clay/terracotta roof tiles (orange-red) | All roofs | ~25% of visible surface |
| Stained glass (polychrome) | Feature window (front facade) | <1% |
| Bronze/gold trim | Circular window surrounds | <1% |
| Timber | Bridge deck, railings, fencing | ~3% |
| Water | Moat | ~5% |
| Dressed stone (surround) | Window and arch surrounds | ~2% |

### Joint Types
- **Masonry joints:** Flush mortar joints, approximately 10mm wide. Very regular and precise coursing throughout.
- **Roof tile joints:** Overlapping interlocking pattern — no visible mortar; dry-laid with mechanical interlock.

### Construction Quality Indicators
- Extremely regular and precise coursing — all stone blocks appear uniform in size.
- Perfect plumb on all visible wall surfaces.
- Consistent window spacing and alignment.
- The overall construction appears idealized/perfect — no visible weathering, staining, or deterioration.

**Confidence: High**

---

## 9. Building Services & MEP (Visible)

- **HVAC:** No visible mechanical systems, vents, or exhausts.
- **Electrical:** No visible conduits, panels, or exterior lighting fixtures.
- **Plumbing:** No visible piping or rainwater systems.
- **Fire safety:** No visible fire escapes, sprinkler connections, or standpipe assemblies.
- **Vertical transport:** No visible elevator indicators. Internal circulation is likely via stone spiral staircases within the corner turrets (inferred from castle typology).

**Confidence: Low** — minimal MEP evidence; this is consistent with a pre-modern or fantasy structure.

---

## 10. Daylighting & Environmental Design

- **Solar orientation:** The primary facade (with stained glass) appears to face south or south-west based on the sunlight direction and shadow patterns. The sun is illuminating the front-left portion of the facade.
- **Daylighting strategy:** Very limited — the small circular windows and thick walls provide minimal natural light. The large stained-glass window would provide dramatic colored light to the main interior hall.
- **Shading devices:** None — the thick masonry walls (~1.0–1.5m) create deep window reveals that inherently shade the interior.
- **Natural ventilation:** Limited given the small window openings. The tower may function as a stack ventilation chimney.

**Confidence: Medium**

---

## 11. Architectural Detail & Ornamentation

### Decorative Elements
- **Stained-glass window:** The centerpiece decorative element — a large Gothic pointed-arch window depicting Princess Peach. Rich polychrome glazing with lead cames. Set within a projecting stone arch frame with decorative hood mould.
- **Circular window surrounds:** Each of the 8 oculus windows has a raised circular frame in bronze/gold, with internal cross-mullion patterns suggesting a decorative rather than purely functional treatment.
- **Flags/pennants:** Four red triangular pennants atop the corner turrets, adding color and heraldic significance.

### Repetitive Patterns
- **Window rhythm:** 4 circular windows across the facade, evenly spaced, repeated on two levels. Module spacing ~4–5m center-to-center.
- **Masonry coursing:** Extremely regular horizontal coursing throughout all walls. Each course is ~0.3m high.
- **Tile pattern:** Consistent scalloped/fish-scale tile pattern across all roof surfaces.

### Transitions
- **Wall to roof:** Clean transition with a minimal eave. No visible fascia or barge board.
- **Turret to main body:** The turrets appear to merge into the main wall at the corners — integrated rather than applied construction.
- **Tower to main roof:** The central tower rises directly through the main roof ridge. The tower base is cylindrical emerging from the hip roof intersection.

**Confidence: High**

---

## 12. Code & Compliance Observations

*Note: Assessed against general building safety principles rather than specific jurisdiction codes.*

- **Egress:** Only one visible entrance/exit (the main arch). For a building of this size, at minimum two remote exits would be required. Corner turret stairs may contain secondary exits on the rear elevation (not visible).
- **Barrier-free access:** The bridge approach has a slight gradient but no visible handrails or tactile indicators. The entrance arch appears to be at grade level — potentially accessible.
- **Fall protection:** No visible parapets or guardrails on any roof surface. The turret flags are on unprotected roof peaks.
- **Moat:** Presents an extreme fall hazard — the ~4–6m vertical drop from ground level to the water surface has no visible barriers, fencing, or guardrails at the edge.

**Confidence: Low** — limited to front elevation observation only.

## 13. Professional Assessment Summary

### Key Architectural Strengths
- **Strong iconic identity:** The bilateral symmetry, central tower, corner turrets, and bold color palette create an immediately recognizable and memorable silhouette.
- **Proportional harmony:** The ratio of tower height to main body height (~2:1) and the balanced placement of turrets create visual stability and grandeur.
- **Material clarity:** The simple two-material palette (grey stone + terracotta tile) is clean and effective. The stained-glass window provides a focal point without overwhelming the composition.
- **Siting:** Positioned behind the foreground hill with a deeply excavated defensive moat creates a dramatic reveal as the player crests the hill. The approach sequence — climb hill, descend toward castle, cross bridge over deep moat, enter arch — creates a compelling processional entry experience.

### Potential Concerns
- **Single point of entry:** Only one visible entrance creates egress and circulation issues.
- **Limited fenestration:** The ~8–10% window-to-wall ratio means very dark interiors, heavily reliant on artificial lighting.
- **Drainage:** No visible rainwater management system — steep roof pitch compensates but may cause erosion at the base.
- **Structural questions:** The central tower is very tall relative to its apparent base width — detailed structural analysis of the masonry tower would be needed.

### 3D Reconstruction Key Dimensions Summary

For implementation in the game engine, the following key proportions should be maintained:

| Element | Width (X) | Height (Y) | Depth (Z) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Main body | 30m | 15m | 22m |
| Central tower (from ground) | 7m dia. | 35m | 7m dia. |
| Corner turrets | 5m dia. | 18m | 5m dia. |
| Main roof | 30m | 8m rise | 22m |
| Entrance arch | 3.5m | 4m | 1.5m deep |
| Bridge | 3.5m | 0.3m deck | 7m span |
| Moat | — | 4–6m deep (below grade) | 5m wide |
| Stained glass window | 3m | 5m | — |
| Circular windows | 1.2m dia. | — | — |

### Comparable Precedents
- **Neuschwanstein Castle** (Bavaria, Germany) — romanticized medieval castle with prominent tower
- **Château de Chambord** (Loire Valley, France) — massive château with central tower and corner turrets
- **Super Mario 64 Peach's Castle** — the direct source material for this structure
- **Disney Cinderella Castle** — similar fairytale castle design language with emphasized verticality
